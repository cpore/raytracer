Project Notes
=============
CS410 Ray Tracer

Building
------------
In the root of the project folder simply type ./build.sh at the command line.
You may need to make build.sh executable by 'typing chmod +x build.sh'
Note that Ant is used to build a jar file. If you have problem building, it is
probably because your JAVA_HOME environment variable is setup incorrectly. If 
you encounter any problems, please ensure this variable refers to a valid Java
JDK.

Running
------------
After building, in the root directory type './run.sh <in/file/path/inputfile> <out/file/path/outputfile'

Alternatively, after building, in the /jar directory type 'java -jar raytracer.jar <in/file/path/inputfile> <out/file/path/outputfile>'

You may need to make run.sh executable by typing chmod +x build.sh
